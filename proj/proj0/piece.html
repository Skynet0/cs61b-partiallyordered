      <h3>What am I looking at?</h3>
      <p>
        In Project 0, we place <em>pieces</em> on the game grid. These pieces
        are represented as another grid in which some cells are "filled".
      </p>
      <p>
        A <code>Piece</code>'s grid is represented internally using a 2D boolean
        array, called <code>_positions</code>. If the cell at that row and
        column inside the <code>Piece</code>'s grid is filled, then
        <code>positions[row][col]</code> is <code>true</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>Piece</code>, which are small grids, are placed on the larger game
        grid. How do we know which cells on the grid to check against cells on
        the <code>Piece</code>?
      </p>
      <p>
        We mark the upper-left cell in the piece as its
        <em>reference point</em>, which may not necessarily be filled. The
        reference point in the <code>Piece</code> above is outlined in
        <span style="color: red">red</span>. For a specific cell on the game
        grid, we align the <code>Piece's</code> reference point with that cell.
        The other cells in the <code>Piece</code> are positioned relative to the
        reference point.
